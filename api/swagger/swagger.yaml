      APIs that manage [creation](/#createPrivateConnection) / [deletion](/#deletePrivateConnection) / [retrieving](/#getone) of exchange connections. 
      

      Most [Public Data APIs](/#ccxt-rest-public-data-api) by most exchanges can be used without providing the API Key and Secret. 
      
      
      For example, you get retrieve the market of binance by doing `GET:/exchange/binance/market` directly and would be able to get
      the markets of binance. 
      
      
      But some exchanges though would require you to use an API Key and Secret even when accessing their Public Data API. For 
      example, for cointiger, if you want to retrieve its market and you do `GET:/exchange/cointiger/market`, you will a `403` error
      (_i.e. meaning you were unauthorized to access it_). Thus, to use that api of continger, you would first have to provide your
      API Key and Secret to continger via `POST:/exchange/continger -d {"id":"myCoinTiger","apiKey":"My-COINTIGER-KEY","secret":"s3cret"}`.
      From there, you will get a response `{"token":"xxx.yyy.zzz"}`. That `"xxx.yyy.zzz"` would then what you will use to connect to
      coiniger - i.e. `GET:/exchange/cointiger/market -H "Authorization: Bearer xxx.yyy.zzz"` and this time, your request will push 
      through and would be able to get cointiger's market.

      
      Furthemore, all [Private Data APIs](/#ccxt-rest-private-data-api) of all exchanges would require API Key and Secret. Thus,
      although `GET:/exchange/binance/market` would work, doing `GET:/exchange/binance/balances` will not. You'd have to provide first
      binance your API Key and Secret like `POST:/exchange/binance -d {"id":"myBinance","apiKey":"binance-key","secret":"s3cret"}`, to
      get something like `{"token":"aaa.bbb.ccc"}`, which you can then use to execute 
      `GET:/exchange/binance/balances -H "Authorization: Bearer aaa.bbb.ccc"` which would finally get your balances.
